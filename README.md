This is the repo for mcaux-ct, my motorcycle auxiliary equipment controller, a quixotic art project for my KLR650.

## Thoughts on long press

Long sw0 is now out3 on/off.

Long sw1 could be aux lights on regardless of headlight state (like during park-light operation). Any change of headlight low/high/off could revert aux lights to wherever they were when long-pressed.

Long sw2 could be unequivocal Off from any On, and On Full from off versus short-press Low.

Multi remains indicator brightness adjustment, need to work out persistence or not

Double-press is an open question... got it, use it?
